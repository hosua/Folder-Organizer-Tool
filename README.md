# Folder Organizer Tool - Made by Hoswoo/Hosua
This tool is useful for managing folders with lots of files. However, this program is primarily made to manage emulator ROM collections. Works best with ROMs that follow the no-intro naming conventions. Works on Windows/Linux. It can also work on Mac, but you will have to run it via Python.
